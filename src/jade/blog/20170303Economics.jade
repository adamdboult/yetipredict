		b Economic agents
	p Economic agents choose options from some set. This could be consumption choices, numbers of hours to work, or how much capital to invest in at a factory.
	p As the outcome of the function is one of the options available to the agent, we can model it by putting a value number on each choice. We can do this by applying a function to each object in the	model. This holds only if the agent is rational, that is, if they prefer A to B, they do not switch to B if C is offered.
	p A simple example would be choosing the number of apples to consume.
	p If the agent always prefers more apples, we can have a function which is always increasing when the number of apples increases.
	p This could be modelled by:
	p $$f=x$$
	p $$f=x^2$$
	p $$f=ln(x)$$
	p These are all monotonically increasing.
	p If the set of choices is more complex, say there are now apples and bananas, we have to be more careful with a representative function.
	p The agent still prefers more apples and more bananas, but the following imply different choices:
	p f=x^2.y^2
	p f=ln(x)+ln(y)
	p In the first example, the agent would always swap an apple for a banana, if they had more apples, whereas the opposite is true in the second case. Functional form is important with multiple goods.
