	h2 First order logic
	p 25th February 2017
	h3 Introduction
	p First-order logic constructs statements, or formulae, which are either true or false.
	p "There exists X such that X is Socrates and X is a man" is a statement in first-order logic.
	p Statements can be evaluated using truth tables and sub-formulae.
	p These statements can include:
	ul
		li Terms
		li Quantifications of terms
		li Predicates
		li Other logical symbols

	h3 Terms
	p Variables are terms.
	p $$ x $$
	p Functions, which take n other terms, are also terms.
	p $$ f(x, y) $$
	p All terms can be derived recursively from this.
	
	h3 Variable quantification
	p In first-order logic variables can be quantified either universally or existentially.
	p There exists x:
	p $$\exists x$$
	p For all x:
	p $$\forall x$$
		
	h3 Formulae
	p Atomic formulas can contain predicates and equality.
	p A predicate takes n variables and is either true of false. This is a formula.
	p $$ P(x) $$
	p Equality between terms can be used to create a formula:
	p $$x = y$$

	p Broader formulas can also be constructed. Quantification can also be attached to a formula:
	p $$ \exists x P(x) $$
	p Negation can be used:
	p $$Â¬P(x)$$
	p Logical connections can be used:
	p $$\theta \rightarrow \delta$$
	p $$\theta \leftarrow \delta$$
	p $$\theta \leftrightarrow \delta$$
	p $$or: \theta \lor \delta$$
	p $$and: \theta \land \delta$$
	p Quantifiers can be added:
	p $$\forall x \exists y (x = y)$$
	
	h3 Evaluating logical connections
	p A formula is either true of false. The value of a large formula can be calculated by examining the its more simple components and then using truth tables.
	p Logical connectors return a truth value depending on the truth value of the two components.
	p As a statement can be true or false, and there are two statements in a logical connection, there are four possible outcomes. TT, TF, FT, FF.
	p As a logical connector can return true or false on any of these, there are 2^4 = 16 types of logical connectors.
	
	h3 Evaluating formulas
	p To evaluate the rest of a formula we can use deductive systems.

	h3 Metalogical properties
	p A system is complete if all true statements can be proved.
	p A system is sound if all provable statements are true.
	p A system is effective if the set of axioms is finite.
	p A system is decidable if there is a process to determine whether an arbitrary formula is valid.
