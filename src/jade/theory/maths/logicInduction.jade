		b Proof by induction
	p We used the inference rules Modus Ponens, which says that if \(X\) is true, and \(X\rightarrow Y\) is true, then \(Y\) is true.
	p This can be used in many ways, including induction for natural number based proofs.
	p For example, let's prove that:
	p GET EXAPLE not with numbers
	h3
		b Proof by contradiction
	p If we have a formula which is true and we undertake allowed actions on it by applying axioms and derived formulas, then the new formulas are also true.
	p As a result, if we can take a statement and use this to derive something we know not to be true, we know the original statement must have been wrong.
	p GET ExAMPLE, not with numbers
