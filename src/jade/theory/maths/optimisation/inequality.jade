		b Lagrangians with inequality constraints
	p We can add constraints to an optimisation problem. These constraints can be equality constraints or inequality constraints. We can write constrained optimisation problem as:
	p Minimise \(f(x)\) subject to 
	p \(g_i(x)\le 0\) for \(i=1,…,m\)
	p \(h_i(x)=0\) for \(i=1,…,p\)
	p We write the Lagrangian as:
	p \(\mathcal{L}(x, \lambda, \nu )=f(x)+\sum_{i=1}^m\lambda_i g_i(x)+\sum_{i=1}^p\nu_ih_i(x)\)
	p If we try and solve this like a standard Lagrangian, then all of the inequality constraints will instead by equality constraints.

		b Affinity of the Lagrangian
	p The Lagrangian function is affine with respect to \(\lambda \) and \(\nu \).
	p \(\mathcal{L}(x, \lambda, \nu )=f(x)+\sum_{i=1}^m\lambda_i g_i(x)+\sum_{i=1}^p\nu_ih_i(x)\)
	p \(\mathcal{L}_{\lambda_i}(x, \lambda, \nu )=g_i(x)\)
	p \(\mathcal{L}_{\nu_i}(x, \lambda, \nu )=h_i(x)\)
	p As the partial differential is constant, the partial differential is an affine function.
	h3
		b Lagrangian dual
	p We can define the Lagrangian dual function:
	p \(g(\lambda, \nu ) = \inf_{x\in X} \mathcal{L}(x, \lambda ,\nu )
	p That is, we have a function which chooses the returns the value of the optimised Lagrangian, given the values of \(\lambda \) and \(\nu\).
	p This is an unconstrained function.
	p We can prove this function is concave (how?).
	p The infimum of a set of concave (and therefore also affine) functions is concave.
	p The supremum of a set of convex (and therefore also affine) functions is convex.


	p Given a function with inputs \(x\), what values of \(x\) maximise the function?
	p We explore constrained and unconstrained optimisation. The former is where restrictions are placed on vector \(x\), such as a budget constraint in economics.
