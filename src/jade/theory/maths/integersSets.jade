	p List all elements
	$$ \{a, 3, 15, 8, f\}$$

		b Predicates
	p All positive real numbers:
	$$\{x \in \mathbb{R} | x>0\}$$
	p All cartesian points beween a line and the x axis.
	$$\{(x, y) \in \mathbb{R} . \mathbb{R} | 0 < y < f(x) \}$$

	p All even numbers
	$$\{n \in \mathbb{N} |(\exists k)[k\in \mathbb{N} \land n=2k]\}$$
	p All rational numbers
	$$\{a\in \mathbb{R} |(\exists p\in \mathbb{Z})(\exists q\in \mathbb{Z})[q\ne 0 \land aq=p]\}$$

		b Power set
	p The power set of a set is the set of all possible subsets, including null.
	p For set \(\{a,b,c\}\). the power set is:
	$$\{\{\},\{a\},	\{b\},\{c\},\{a,b\},\{a,c\},\{b,c\},\{a,b,c\}\}$$	
	p
		b Sigma-algebra
	p Sigma-algebra, or \(\sigma\)-algebra, refers to collection \(\Sigma\) of subsets which are:
	ul
		li Includes the null set
		li Is closed under compliment. If a subset is included, a subset containing all other elements is included.
		li Is closed under countable union. For any collection of subsets, a subset containing all their elements is also present.
	p Examples of sigma algebras include
	ul
		li The power set
		li The null set and the original set
