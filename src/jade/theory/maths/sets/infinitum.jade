		b Introduction
	p The infinitum and supremum of a set are roughly the minimum and maximum respectively.
	h3
		b Infinitum
	p Consider a subset \(S\) of a partially ordered set \(T\).
	p The infinitum of \(S\) is the greatest element in \(T\) that is less than or equal to all elements in \(S\).
	p For example:
	p \(\inf [0,1]=0\)
	p \(\inf (0,1)=0\)
	h3
		b Supremum
	p The supremum is the opposite: the smallest element in \(T\) which is greater than or equal to all elements in \(S\).
	p \(\sup [0,1]=1\)
	p \(\sup (0,1)=1\)
