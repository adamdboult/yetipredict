block subSubContent
	h3
		b Defining sets by enumeration
	p We can describe a set by the elements it contains.
	p $$s=\{a,b,c\}$$
	p This is a shorthand way of writing:
	p $$\forall x (x\in s \leftrightarrow (x=a\lor x=b \lor x=c))$$
	h3
		b Empty set
	p We can use this to define the empty set - the set with no members.
	p \(\varnothing =\{\}\)
	p Using the above definition this is the same as writing:
	p $$\forall x Â¬(x\in \varnothing )$$

	p Without the axiom of extentionality there could be many different empty sets, which are equal to each other.
