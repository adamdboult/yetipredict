		b Motivation
	p Say we have a preterite \(P(x)\) which is true for some values of \(x\). Sets allow us to explore the properties of these values.
	p We may want to talk about a collection of terms for which \(P(x)\) is true, which we call a set.
	p To do this we need to introduce new axioms, however first we can add (conservative) definitions to help us do this.
	h3
		b Membership
	p We introduce a new relation: membership. If element \(x\) is in set \(s\) then the following relation is true, otherwise it is false:
	p $$x\in s$$
	p Sets are also terms. In first-order logic they will be included in quantifiers. Indeed, in set theory, we aim to treat everything as sets.
	h3
		b Non-membership
	p If a term is not a member of another term, we can write this using the non-member relation as follows:
	p $$\forall x \forall s [Â¬(x\in s)\leftrightarrow x\not\in s]$$

	h3
		b Subset
	p If all terms which are members of term \(x\) are also members of term \(y\), then \(x\) is a subset of \(y\).
	p $$\forall x\forall y[(\forall z(z\in x\rightarrow z\in y))\leftrightarrow (x\subseteq y)]$$
	h3
		b Proper subset
	p If two sets are equal, then each is a subset of the other. A proper subset is one which is a subset, and not equal to the other set.
	p $$\forall x\forall y[((\forall z(z\in x\rightarrow z\in y)))\land(x\ne y)\leftrightarrow (x\subset y)]$$
