		b Definition
	p Orderings define relations between elements in a set, where one element can preceed the other. 
	p Orderings are antisymmetric. That is, the only case where the relation is satisfied in both directions is if the elements are equal.
	p $$(a\le b)\land (b\le a)\rightarrow (a=b)$$
	p Orderings are transitive. That is: 
	p $$(a\le b)\land (b\le c)\rightarrow (a\le c)$$
	h3
		b Strict and non-strict order
	p The relation \(\le \) is refered to as non-strict.
	p There is a similar strict relation relation, \(<\):
	p $$(a\le b)\land Â¬(b\le a)\rightarrow (a < b)$$

	h3
		b Totally- and partially-ordered sets
	p A totally ordered set is one where the relation is defined on all pairs:
	p $$\forall a \forall b	(a\le b)\lor (b\le a)$$
	p Note that totality implies reflexivity.
	p A partially ordered set, or poset, is one where the relation is defined between each element and itself.
	p $$\forall a (a\le a)$$
	p That is, every element is related to itself.
	h3
		b Well-ordering
	p A well-ordering on a set is a total order on the set where the set contains a minimum number. For example the relation \(\le \) on the natural numbers is a well-ordering because \(0\) is the minimum.
	p The relation \(\le \) on the integers however is not a well-ordering, as there is no minimum number in the set.
	h3
		b Intervals
	p For a totally ordered set we can define a subset as being all elements with a relationship to a number. For example:
	p $$[a,b]=\{x:a\le x \land x\le b\}$$
	p This denotes a closed interval. Using the definition above we can also define an open interval:
	p $$(a,b)=\{x:a< x \land x< b\}$$


	h3
		b Ordering of the natural numbers
	p For natural numbers we can say that number \(n\) preceeds number \(s(n)\). That is:
	p $$n\le s(n)$$
	p Similarly:
	p $$s(n)\le s(s(n))$$
	p From the transitive property we know that:
	p $$n\le s(s(n))$$
	p We can continue this to get:
	p $$n\le s(s(...s(n)..))$$
	p What can we say about an arbitary comparison?
	p $$a\le b$$
	p We know that either:
	ul
		li $$a=b$$
		li $$b=s(s(...s(a)...))$$
		li $$a=s(s(...s(b)...))$$

	p In the first case the relation holds.
	p In the second case the relation holds.
	p In the third case the relation does not hold, but antisymmetry holds.
	p As this is is then defined on any pair, the order on natural numbers is total.
	p As there is a minimum, \(0\), the relation is also well-ordered.
	p However if this does not hold then the following instead holds:
