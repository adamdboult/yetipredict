	p Orderings define relations between elements in a set, where one element can preceed the other. 
	p Orderings are antisymmetric. That is, the only case where the relation is satisfied in both directions is if the elements are equal.
	p $$(a\le b)\land (b\le a)\rightarrow (a=b)$$
	p Orderings are transitive. That is: 
	p $$(a\le b)\land (b\le c)\rightarrow (a\le c)$$

	p The relation \(\le \) is refered to as non-strict.
	p There is a similar strict relation relation, \(<\):
	p $$(a\le b)\land Â¬(b\le a)\rightarrow (a < b)$$
