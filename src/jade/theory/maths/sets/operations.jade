	h3
		b Introduction
	p We discuss functions. Just because we can write a function of sets which exist, does not mean the results of the functions exist. For that we need axioms discussed later.
	h3
		b Union function
	p We define a function on two sets, \(a\lor b\), such that the result contains all elements from either sets.
	p $$\forall a \forall x \forall y [a\in (x\lor y) \leftrightarrow (a\in x \lor a\in y)]$$
	p This is commutative: \(a\lor b = b\lor a\)
	p This is associative: \((a\lor b)\lor c = a\lor (b\lor c)\)
	h3
		b Intersection function
	p We define a function, \(a\land b\), on two sets, such that the result contains all elements which are in both.
	p $$\forall a \forall x \forall y [a\in (x\land y) \leftrightarrow (a\in x \land a\in y)]$$
	p This is commutative: \(a\land b = b\land a\)
	p This is associative: \((a\land b)\land c = a\lor (b\land c)\)
	h3
		b Distribution of union and intersection
	p Union is distributive over intersection: \(a\lor (b\land c)=(a\lor b)\land (a\lor c)\)
	p Intersection is distributive over union: \(a\land (b\lor c)=(a\land b)\lor (a\land c)\)
	h3
		b Complement function
	p \(x^C\) is the completement. It is defined such that:
	p $$\forall x [x\land x^C=\varnothing ]$$
	h3
		b Disjoint sets
	p Sets are disjoint is there is no overlap in their elements. Two sets are \(s_i\) and \(s_j\) are mutually exclusive if:
	p \(s_i\land s_j=\emptyset\)
	p A collection of events \(s\) are all mutually exclusive if all pairs are mutually exclusive. That is:
	p \(\forall s_i \in s\forall s_j\in s[s_i\land s_j\ne \emptyset \rightarrow s_i=s_j]\)

	h3
		b Complement function
	p For a set \(b\), the complement with respect to \(a\) is all elements in \(a\) which are not in \(b\).
	p \(\forall x \in a \forall y \in b [x \in (a \setminus b) \land y\in (a \setminus b)]\)
	p \(b\land (a \setminus b)= \varnothing \)
	p That is, \(b\) and \(a \setminus b\) are disjoint.
	h3
		b Tuples
	p We can get a list of sets in an order. A 2-tuple is an ordered pair:
	p \((a, b)\)
	p We can write an ordered pair of \(a\) and \(b\) as:
	p $$\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}$$
	h3
		b Cartesian product
	p The cartesian product takes two sets, and creates a set containing all ordered pairs of \(a\) and \(b\).
	p \(a\times b\)
	h3
		b Powerset
	p The power set of \(s\), \(P(s)\), contains all subsets of \(s\).
	p $$\forall x x\subseteq s \leftrightarrow x\in P(x)$$
	p Do all subsets exist?? show elsewhere.
