		b Describing  functions
	p If function \(f\) maps from set \(X\) to set \(Y\) we can write this as:
	p $$f:X\rightarrow Y$$
	p We can \(X\) the domain, and \(Y\) the codomain.
	p The function may only map onto a subset of the codomain. We call this subset the image.
	p For example consider the function which takes natural numbers and doubles them.
	p $$f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow \mathbb{N}$$
	p Both the domain and the codomain are the natural numbers. The image is the set of positive even numbers.
