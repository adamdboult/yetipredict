		b Axioms of equality
	p In order to expand logic to allow for arithmetic, we first introduce the concept of equality. This is a relation between \(2\) variables, described with the following axioms.
	p
		b Reflexivity
	p All things are equal to themselves.
	p $$\forall x(x=x)$$
	p
		b Symmetry
	p The order of equality does not matter.
	p $$\forall x \forall y[(x=y)\rightarrow y=x]$$
	p
		b Transitivity
	p Equality is transitive.
	p $$\forall x \forall y \forall z[(x=y \land y=z) \rightarrow x=z]$$
	p
		b Substitution for functions
	p If \(2\) terms are equal, the same function on both of them gives equal terms.
	p $$\forall x \forall y[(x=y)\rightarrow (f(x)=f(y))]$$
	p
		b Substitution for formulae
	p If a term satisfies a predicate, all terms equal to it also satisfy the predicate.
	p $$\forall x \forall y[((x=y)\land P(x))\rightarrow P(y)]$$

	h3
		b Using equality to describe functions
	p
		b Injective functions
	p Note that we already know:
	p $$\forall x\forall y[(f(x)=f(y))\leftarrow (x=y)]$$
	p Function \(f\) is injective if it is a one-to-one mapping.

	p $$\forall x\forall y[(f(x)=f(y))\leftrightarrow (x=y)]$$
	p This requires only that:
	p $$\forall x\forall y[(f(x)=f(y))\rightarrow (x=y)]$$
	p
		b Surjective
	p Function \(f\) is surjective if:
	p $$\forall y \exists x [f(x)=y]$$
	p
		b Bijective
	p Function is bijective if it is both injective and surjective.
	p
		b Inverse function
	p For a function:
	p $$f(x)$$
	p \(g(y)\) is an inverse function of \(f(x)\) if:
	p $$\forall x [g(f(x))=x]$$
