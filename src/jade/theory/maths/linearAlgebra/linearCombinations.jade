	h3
		b Introduction
	p We can write vectors as combinations of other vectors.
	p \(v=\sum_i \alpha_i v_i\)
	h3
		b Linear spans
	p We can take a subset \(S\) of \(V\). We can then make linear combinations of these elements.
	p This is called the linear span - \(L(S)\).
	h3
		b Finite and infinite vector spaces
	p If there is a finite \(S\) such that \(L(S)=V\), then we say the vector space \(V\) is finite.
	p Otherwise, we say the vector space is infinite.

	h3
		b Linear dependence
	p A collection of vectors in a vector space are linearly dependent if there exist values for \(\alpha \) (other than all being \(0\)) such that:
	p \(\sum_i \alpha_i v_i =0\).
	p If no such values for \(\alpha \) exist we say the vectors are linearly independent.

	h3
		b Basis
	p A subset which spans the vector space, and which is also linearly independent, is a basis of the vector space.
	p All bases have the same size. The size \(|S|\) is the dimenion of the vector space.
