		b Linear maps
	p A linear map (or function) is a map from one input to an output which preserves addition and scalar multiplication.
	p That is if function \(f\) is linear then:
	p $$f(aM+bN)=af(M)+bf(N)$$
	p Linear form
	p A linear form is a special type of linear map, which takes a vector and returns a scalar.
	p Let’s consider what this implies.
	p $$v=[a_1,…,a_n]$$
	p $$v=[a_1,…,0]+...+[0,…,a_n]$$
	p $$f(v)=f([a_1,…,a_n])
	p $$f(v)=f([a_1,…,0]+...+[0,…,a_n])$$
	p Because a linear map is linear in additon:
	p $$f(v)=f([a_1,…,0])+...+f([0,…,a_n])$$
	p $$f(v)=f(a_1[1,…,0])+...+f(a_n[0,…,1])$$
	p Because a linear map is linear in scaling:
	p $$f(v)=a_1f([1,…,0])+...+a_nf([0,…,1])$$
	p Because the function terms are now independent of the vector:
	p $$f(v)=a_1f_1+...+a_nf_n$$
	p $$f(v)=fv$$
	p That is, the linear form is a vector multiplication.

		b Biliear map
	p A bilinear map (or function) is a map from two inputs to an output which preserves addition and scalar multiplication. This is in contrast to a linear map, which only has one input.
	p In addition, the function is linear in both arguments.
	p That is if function \(f\) is bilinear then:
	p $$X=aM+bN$$
	p $$Y=cO+dP$$
	p $$f(X,Y)=f(aM+bN,cO+dP)$$
	p $$f(X,Y)=f(aM,cO+dP)+f(bN,cO+dP)$$
	p $$f(X,Y)=f(aM,cO)+f(aM,dP)+f(bN,cO)+f(bN,dP)$$
	p $$f(X,Y)=acf(M,O)+adf(M,P)+bcf(N,O)+bdf(N,P)$$
	p Note that:
	p $$f(X,Y)=f(X+0,Y)$$
	p $$f(X,Y)=f(X,Y)+f(0,Y)$$
	p $$(0,Y)=0$$
	p That is, if any input is \(0\) in an additative sense, the value of the map must be zero.

		b Bilinear form
	p A bilinear form is a special type of bilinear map, which takes a vector and returns a scalar.
	h3
		b Multilinear map
	p This extends from \(2\) inputs to an arbitrary number of inputs.
	h3
		b Multilinear form
	p A special type of multilinear map which takes vectors and returns a scalar.
	p $$f(M)=f([v_1,…,v_n])$$
	p We introduce \(e_i\), the element vector. This is \(0\) for all entries except for \(i\) where it is \(1\). Any vector can be shown as a sum of these vectors multiplied by a scalar.
	p $$f(M)=f([\sum^m_{i=1}v_{1i}e_i,…,\sum^m_{i=1}v_{ni}e_i])$$
	p $$f(M)=\sum^m_{k_1=1}f([v_{1k_1}e_{k_1},…,\sum^m_{i=1}v_{ni}e_i])$$
	p $$f(M)=\sum^m_{k_1=1}...\sum^m_{k_n=1}f([v_{1k_1}e_{k_1},…,v_{nk_n}e_{k_n}])$$
	p Because this in linear in scalars:
	p $$f(M)=\sum^m_{k_1=1}...\sum^m_{k_n=1}\prod_{j=1}^nv_{jk_j}f([e_{k_1},…,e_{k_n}])$$
