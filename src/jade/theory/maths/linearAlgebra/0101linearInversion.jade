	p Matrix inversion
	p Matrix inversion in operations to this section.
	p Definition
	p An invertible matrix implies that if the matrix is multiplied by another matrix, the original matrix can be recovered. That is, for all matrices \(A\), the left and right inverses of \(B\), \(B_L^{-1}\) and \(B_R^{-1}\), are defined such that:
	p $$A(BB_R^{-1})=A$$
	p $$A(B_L^{-1}B)=A$$
	p Only square matrices have inversions

	p Linearly dependent matrices are not invertible

	p Left and right matrices are unique

	p Left and right inversions are equal
	p Note that if the left inverse exists then:
	p $$B_L^{-1}B=I$$
	p And if the right inverse exists:
	p $$BB_R^{-1}=I$$
	p Letâ€™s take the first:
	p $$B_L^{-1}B=I$$
	p $$B_L^{-1}BB_L^{-1}=B_L^{-1}$$
	p $$B_L^{-1}BB_L^{-1}-B_L^{-1}=0$$
	p $$B_L^{-1}(BB_L^{-1}-I)=0$$
	p Orthogonal matrix
	p $$M^TM=MM^T=I$$
	p Unitary matrix
	p The orthogonal matrix generalises to the unitary matrix
	p $$M*M=MM*=I$$
	p Inversion of products
	p (AB)(AB)^{-1}=I
	p A^{-1}AB(AB)^{-1}=A^{-1}
	p B^{-1}B(AB)^{-1}=B^{-1}A^{-1}
	p (AB)^{-1}=B^{-1}A^{-1}
	p Inversion of a diagonal matrix
	p $$DD^{-1}=I$$
	p $$D_{ii}D_{ii}^{-1}=1$$
	p $$D_{ii}^{-1}=\frac{1}{D_{ii}}$$

		b Matrix inversion
	p We can think of the inverse of a matrix as one which which takes a series of reverible operations and does these to a matrix then arriving at the identity matrix.
	p That is, only the three elementary row operations, and combinations of them, can transform a matrix in a way in which it can be reversed. As such All reversible matricies are combinations of the identity matrix and a series of elementary row operations. The inverse matrix is then those series of row operations, in reverse.
	p We can find identify an inversion by undertaking gaussian elimination. Each step done on the matrix is done to the identify matrix, reversing the process. The end result is the inverted matrix.

	p Instead of:
	p $$(A|y)=\begin{bmatrix}2 & 1&-1&|&-8\\-3 & -1&2&|&-11\\-2&1&2&|&-3\end{bmatrix}$$
	p Take:
	p $$(A|I)=\begin{bmatrix}2 & 1&-1&|&1&0&0\\-3 & -1&2&|&0&1&0\\-2&1&2&|&0&0&1\end{bmatrix}$$
	p When we solve this we get:
	p $$(I|A^{-1})=\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0&0&|&\frac{3}{4}&\frac{1}{2}&\frac{1}{4}\\0& 1&0&|&\frac{1}{2}&1&\frac{1}{2}\\0&0&1&|&\frac{1}{4}&\frac{1}{2}&\frac{3}{4}\end{bmatrix}$$

		b Inverted matrix and solving equations
	p We started off with:
	p $$Ax=y$$
	p We now know \(A^{-1}\) so we can calculate:
	p $$A^{-1}Ax=A^{-1}y$$
	p $$x=A^{-1}y$$
