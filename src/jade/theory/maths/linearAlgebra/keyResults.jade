		b Transpose rules
	p $$(M^T)^T=M$$
	p $$(AB)^T=B^TA^T$$
	p $$(A+B)^T=A^T+B^T$$
	p $$(zM)^T=zM^T$$

	h3
		b Conjugation rules
	p $$(A^*)^*=A$$
	p $$(AB)^*=A^*B^*$$
	p $$(A+B)^*=A^*+B^*$$
	p $$(zM)^*=z^*M^*$$

	h3
		b Transposition
	p A matrix of dimensions \(m*n\) can be transformed into a matrix \(n*m\) by transposition.
	p $$B=A^T$$
	p $$b_{ij}=a{ji}$$
	p Transposing twice results in the original matrix. Transposing also allows vectors to be transformed from horizontal to vertical.
	h3
		b Conjugate transposition
	p Like transposition, but with conjucate.
	p $$B=A^*$$
	p $$b_{ij}=\bar{a_{ji}}$$
	p Alternatively, and particularly in physics, the following symbol is often used instead.
	p $$(A^*)=A^\dagger$$
