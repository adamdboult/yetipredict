		b Eigen-decomposition
	p If \(A\) is full rank:
	p $$A=Q\Lambda Q^{-1}$$
	p Where \(Q\) is the eigenvectors as columns, and \(\Lambda \) is a diagonal matrix with the corresponding eigenvalues.
	p From the definition of eigenvectors,
	p $$Av=\lambda v$$
	p $$Av=v\lambda $$
	p So we can generalise for all vectors
	p $$AQ=Q\Lambda $$
	p $$A=Q\Lambda Q^{-1}$$
	p This can be used to invert \(A\).
	p We know that:
	p $$A^{-1}=(Q\Lambda Q^{-1})^{-1}$$
	p $$A^{-1}=Q^{-1}\Lambda^{-1}Q$$
	p We know \(\Lambda \) can be easily inverted by taking the reciprocal of each diagonal element. We already know both \(Q\) and its inverse from the decomposition.
