		b Proof by inference

		b Some tautologies
	p The following tautologies are used later in this section. For later readability these are referred to as axioms.
	p
		b Axiom 1 – Simplification
	p If it is cloudy, then if it is a Tuesday it is also cloudy.
	p $$\theta \rightarrow (\gamma \rightarrow \theta )$$
	p
		b Axiom 2 – Frege
	p $$(\alpha \rightarrow (\beta \rightarrow \gamma ))\rightarrow ((\alpha \rightarrow \beta )\rightarrow(\alpha \rightarrow \gamma ))$$
	p
		b Axiom 3 – Transposition
	p If there are no clouds in the sky, it is not raining. If it is raining there are clouds in the sky
	p $$(¬\theta \rightarrow ¬\gamma )\rightarrow (\gamma \rightarrow \theta )$$
	p Each of these axioms and the inference rule can be proven to always to be true with a truth table. They are tautologies.
	p
		b Axiom 4 - existence
	p $$\forall xP(x)\rightarrow P(r)$$

	p If \(P\) is true for all values of \(x\), then \(P\) is true for any input to \(P\).
	p
		b Axiom 5 - universal
	p $$P(r)\rightarrow \exists xF(x)$$
	p If \(P\) is true for term \(x\) as input, then there exists an input for \(P\) where \(P\) is true.
		
	h3
		b Substitution
	p If we have a tautology, then we can substitute the formula of any propositional variable with any formula to arrive at any other tautology.
	p
		b Example
	p 
	h3
		b Induction
	p We want to combine statements. That is, given that we know two formulae are true, what other formulae are true.
	p The use the logical symbol implication is useful here. That is, we want:
	p $$A\land B \rightarrow C$$
	p That is, if we can find formulae for \(A\) and \(B\) where this is always true, we can use axioms to generate formulae for \(C\).

	p We can prove the axioms of first-order logic are tautologies.
	p We can prove the inference rule is a tautology.
	p Every new formula in the theory is an application of proven true formulae, and therefore is also true.
	p Therefore the theory of provably true axioms and inference rule includes only tautologies.
	p Therefore the theory is sound.


	p Another way to evaluate a formula is through inference.
	p We take a set of axioms, as true, and a deduction rule which enables us to derive additional formulae, or theorems. The collection of axioms and theorems is known as the theory.
	p Theorems often divided into:
	ul
		li Theorems - important results
		li Lemmas - results used for later theorems
		li Corollaries - readily deduced from a theorem
	p For our axioms, we can use formulae we already know are true, tautologies. We can then add an induction rule.
	p
		b Modus Ponens
	p This introduces for \(A\), \(\theta \rightarrow \gamma \), and for \(B\) \(\theta \). We then can deduce \(\gamma \) for \(C\).
	p $$((\theta \rightarrow \gamma )\land (\theta ))\rightarrow \gamma $$
	p
		b Soundness of induction
	h3
		b Example of inference
	p Let use these to derive a theorem:
	p $$\alpha \rightarrow \alpha $$
	p Start with axiom 2:
	p $$(\alpha \rightarrow (\beta \rightarrow \gamma ))\rightarrow ((\alpha \rightarrow \beta )\rightarrow(\alpha \rightarrow \gamma ))$$
	p Replace \(\gamma \) with \(\alpha \).
	p $$(\alpha \rightarrow (\beta \rightarrow \alpha ))\rightarrow ((\alpha \rightarrow \beta )\rightarrow(\alpha \rightarrow \alpha ))$$
	p Replace \(\beta \) with \((\alpha \rightarrow \alpha )\).
	p $$(\alpha \rightarrow ((\alpha \rightarrow \alpha ) \rightarrow \alpha ))\rightarrow ((\alpha \rightarrow (\alpha \rightarrow \alpha ))\rightarrow(\alpha \rightarrow \alpha ))$$
	p Separately, take axiom 1:
	p $$\alpha \rightarrow (\beta \rightarrow \alpha)$$
	p And replace \(\beta \) with \((\alpha \rightarrow \alpha )\)
	p $$\alpha \rightarrow ((\alpha \rightarrow \alpha )\rightarrow \alpha)$$
	p This is the left side of the above equation. Through modus ponens, we then know:
	p $$(\alpha \rightarrow (\alpha \rightarrow \alpha)) \rightarrow (\alpha \rightarrow \alpha)$$
	p We know the left is true through modus ponens, and so
	p $$\alpha \rightarrow \alpha $$
	h3
		b Axioms and definitions
	p We can also add definitions. For example we could add the following statement:
	p $$\forall x P(x)$$
	p That is, we define a predicate which is true for all inputs. Adding this does not allow us to prove any universally true statements beyond our orignal axioms.
	p That is, we can prove no additional theorems beyond the original theory. It is a conservative extension of the original theory.
