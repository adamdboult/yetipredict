		b Relations
	p We previously showed how predicates could be used to assign truth values to statements involving terms. A special type of these are relations.
	p These are written differently to predicates. Which a predicate may be written:
	p $$P(a,b)$$
	p $$P(x,y)\leftrightarrow x\dotcircle y$$
	p A relation would be written:
	p $$a\dotcircle b$$
	p
		b Examples of relations
	p While we will not formally introduce relations here, key examples include:
	ul
		li Equality \((a=b)\)
		li Membership \((a\in b)\)
		li Ordinality \((a < b)\)
	p Each of these could also be shown in the form:
	p $$P(a,b)$$
	p
		b Inverse relations
	p Consider
	p $$P(a,b)$$
	p There is another relation where which is equivalent
	p $$Q(b,a)$$
	p
		b Are relations always defined?
	p Is the following true?
	p $$P(a,b) \lor Q(a,b)$$
