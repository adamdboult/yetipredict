		b Functions
	p Functions take other terms, and are themselves terms. For example if we wanted to know the age because of a law in a country, we could use:
	p $$P(you,age(UK))$$
	p A function may not be able to produce an output for all inputs. For examples \(age(green)\) has no interpretation.
	p
		b Constants
	p Like predicates, functions can also take different numbers of inputs. Constants, such as “you” and “britain” could be considered functions with \(0\) inputs. As a result we could instead use:
	p $$P(you(),age(UK()))$$
	p We generally denote functions with a lower case letter, so would instead write:
	p $$P(y(),a(b()))$$
