	h2
		b Equivalence
	p We show why only unary and binary operators are needed.
	h3
		b Need for only a subset of binary operators
	p
		b Reduction to \(8\) binary operators
	p While there are \(16\) possible binary operators, we do not need to use all of these. We will use as standard:
	ul
		li and, \(\land \)
		li or, \(\lor \)
		li if, then \(\rightarrow \)
		li negation \(¬\)
	p First, consider the use of negation. We can cut the number from \(16\) to \(8\) by using the negation symbol.
	p For example if we want an operator to return true if and only if both inputs are false we use NAND.
	p \(\theta \) NAND \(\gamma \)
	p This is logically the same as:
	p $$¬(\theta \land \gamma )$$
	p
		b Removal on unconditionals
	p Additionally we can get rid of the \(1\)which returns \(T\) regardless of inputs (originally there was one for \(F\) but we cut it down to one in the above section).
	p Additionally we also have \(2\) which only depends on one input, which we can use a unary operator for instead.
	p This leaves us with \(5\).
	p
		b A few more
	p Now consider:
	p $$\theta \leftarrow \gamma$$
	p That is, if \(\gamma \) is true, \(\theta \) is true. We can get the same outputs using:
	p $$\gamma \rightarrow \theta$$
	p So now we have \(4\).
	p One of these returns true only if the inputs are identical. This is XNOR.
	p We can write this as:
	p $$(\theta \rightarrow \gamma)\land (\gamma \rightarrow \theta )$$
	p This leaves us with our original \(3\).
	p Other sets can also be used to derive the complete \(16\). In particular the \(16\) can all be derived from combinations of either NAND (false if both sides are true) or NOR (true if both sides are false).
	h3
		b Lack of need for n-ary operators
	p Similarly, n-ary operators can be defined in terms of binary operators.
	p As an example if we want an operator to return positive if all inputs are true, we can use:
	p $$(\theta \land \gamma )\land \beta $$
	p Note that here we have added brackets. These indicate that the operation inside the brackets should be undertaken before interacting with the outside.
	h3
		b Conjunctive  and Disjunctive Normal Forms (CNF and DNF)
	p We can go further and reduce the \(3\)  and negation to just:
	ul
		li and, \(\land \)
		li or, \(\lor \)
		li The unary negation \(¬\)
	p We do this by eliminating the \(\rightarrow \) operator. Note the following are the same.
	p $$\theta \rightarrow \gamma$$
	p $$¬\theta \lor (\theta \land \gamma )$$
	p
		b Conjunective normal form
	p The conjunctive normal form (CNF) is where a formula is converted to this form, and then is shown is the form of:
	p $$a \land b \land c \land d$$
	p These letters can represent complex sub-formulae.
	p Statements in this form are easier to evaluate, as each subformula can be evaluated separately. The statement is true only if all formulaes within are also true.
	p
		b Disjunctive normal form
	p The disjunctive normal form (DNF) is similar for \(\lor \).
	p $$a \lor b \lor c \lor d$$
