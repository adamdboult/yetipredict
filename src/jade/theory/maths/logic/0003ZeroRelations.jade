		b Relations
	p We previously showed how predicates could be used to assign truth values to statements involving terms. A special type of these are relations.
	p These are written differently to predicates. Which a predicate may be written:
	p $$P(a,b)$$
	p A relation would be written:
	p $$a\crosscircle b$$
	p
		b Examples of relations
	p While we will not formally introduce relations here, key examples include:
	ul
		li Equality \((a=b)\)
		li Membership \((a\in b)\)
		li Ordinality \((a < b)\)
	p Each of these could also be shown in the form:
	p $$P(a,b)$$
