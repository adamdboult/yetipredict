		b Types of quantifiers
	p
		b Existential quantifier
	p We introduce a shorthand for “at least one term satisfies a predicate”, that is:
	p $$P(x_0)\lor P(x_1)\lor P(x_2)\lor P(x_2)\lor P(x_3)…$$
	p The short hand is:
	p $$\exists x P(x)$$
	p
		b Universal quantifier
	p We introduce another shorthand, this time for:
	p $$P(x_0)\land P(x_1)\land P(x_2)\land P(x_2)\land P(x_3)…$$
	p The shorthand is
	p $$\forall x P(x)$$

		b Quantifiers and variables
	p
		b Free and bound variables
	p A bound variable is one which is quantified in the formula. A free variable is one which is not.
	p
		b Ground terms
	p A ground term does not contain any free variables. A ground formulae is one which only includes ground terms.
	
	h3
		b First-order logic
	p These iterate across a set. Increasing the number of terms \(x\) can take requires updating the formula for zero-order logic, but not here. As a result we call this first-order logic.
	p
		b Limitations of truth tables
	p As we noted in zero-order logic, evaluating truth table becomes more difficult as more variables are added. The addition of quantifiers presents an additional problem.
	p The truth table must now iterate over the quantified variables, which can be arbitrarily large. Instead we need a new approach.
