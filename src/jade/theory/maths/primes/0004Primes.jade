	p A prime number is a number which does not have any divisors other than \(1\) and itself.
	p By convention we do not refer to \(0\) or \(1\) as prime numbers.
	h3
		b Identifying prime numbers
	p Divisors must be smaller than the number. As a result it is easy to identify early prime numbers, as we can try to divide by all preceding numbers.

		b Examples of prime numbers
