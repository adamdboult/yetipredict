block subSubContent
	h3
		b Hermitian matrix
	p A matrix where \(a_{ij}=\bar a_{ji}\) is Hermitian.
	p Where \(\bar a_{ji}\) is the complex conjugate of \(a_{ji}\).
	p All Hermitian matrices are symmetric.
	p The identity matrix is an example.


	h3
		b Real eigenvalues
	p Hermitian matrices have real eigenvalues.
	p \(Hv=\lambda v\)
	p \(v^*Hv=\lambda v^*v\)
	p \(v^*Hv=\lambda \)
	h3
		b Skew-Hermitian matrices
	p These are also known as anti-Hermitian matrices.
	p \(M^*=-M\)
