		b Integers
	p To extend the number line to negative numbers, we define:
	p $$\forall ab \in \mathbb{N} \exists c (a+c=b)$$
	p For any pair of numbers there exists a terms which can be added to one to get the other.
	p For \(1+x=3\) this is another natural number, however for \(3+x=1\) there is no such number.
	p Integers are defined as the solutions for any pair of natural numbers.
	p Can we add and multiply integers? If we consider an integer to by an ordered pair of natural numbers, such that:
	p $$(a,b)=a-b$$
	p Natural numbers can be shown as integers by using:
	p $$(n,0)$$
	p Then we can define addition as:
	p $$(a,b)+(c,d)=(a+c,b+d)$$
	p Similarly, multiplication can be defined as:
	p $$(a,b).(c,d)=(ac+bd, ad+bc)$$

		b Rational numbers
	p We previously defined integers in terms of natural numbers. Similarly we can define rational numbers in terms of integers.
	p $$\forall ab \in \mathbb{I} (Â¬(b=0)\rightarrow \exists c (b.c=a))$$
	p So that:
	p $$(a,b)=a/b$$
	p Integers can be shown as rational numbers using:
	p $$(i,1)$$
	p Then we can define addition as:
	p $$(a,b)+(c,d)=(a.d+b.c,b.d)$$
	p Similarly, multiplication can be defined as:
	p $$(a,b).(c,d)=(a.c, b.d)$$

		b Real numbers
	p Not all numbers can be shown as fractions. \(\sqrt 2\), \(\pi\). No way to have ordered set.
	p Let's prove there are numbers which are not rational. Consider \(\sqrt 2\) and let's show that it being rational leads to a contradiction.
	$$\sqrt 2=\frac{x}{y}$$
	p $$2=\frac{x^2}{y^2}$$
	p $$2y^2=x^2$$
	p So we know that \(x^2\) is even, and can be shown as \(x=2n\).
	p $$2y^2=(2n)^2$$
	p $$y^2=2n^2$$
	p So \(y\) is even. But if both \(x\) and \(y\) are even, then the fraction was not reduced.
	p This presents a contraction so the original statement must have been false.

	p So we know there isn't a rational solution to \(\sqrt 2\), but how should we think about this value?
	p We previously discussed cauchy sequences, and completeness. A series of rational numbers can converge arbitrarily close towards \(\sqrt 2\) but never reach it. By adding these points which rational numbers can converge towards we create the real numbers.
