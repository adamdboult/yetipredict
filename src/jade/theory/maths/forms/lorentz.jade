		b Introduction
	p The Lorentz group is the \(O(1,3)\) group.

		b Symmetries of the Lorentz group
	p We can do the usual \(3\) rotations, however there are additional \(3\) symmetries, making the Lorzentz group \(6\)-dimensional.
	p These are the Lorentz boosts.
	p A symmetry has:
	p \(t'^2-x'2-y'^2-z'^2=t^2-x^2-y^2-z^2\)
	p We consider the case wherewe just boost on \(x\), so \(y=y'\) and \(z=z'\).
	p \(t'^2-x'2=t^2-x^2\)
	p Or with \(c\):
	p \(c^2t'^2-x'2=t^2-x^2\)
