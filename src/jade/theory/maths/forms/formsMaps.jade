		b Multilinear forms
	p This is a generalisation of the bilinear form. A multilinear form takes multiple vectors and returns a scalar from the underlying field.
	p This can be done to a matrix, by treating each column as a separate vector.

	p $$f(M)=f([v_1,...,v_n])$$
	p We introduce \(e_i\), the element vector. This is \(0\) for all entries except for \(i\) where it is \(1\). Any vector can be shown as a sum of these vectors multiplied by a scalar.
	p $$f(M)=f([\sum^m_{i=1}a_{1i}e_i,...,\sum^m_{i=1}a_{ni}e_i])$$
	p $$f(M)=\sum_{k_1=1}^m...\sum_{k_n=1}f([a_{1k_1}e_{k_1},...,a_{nk_n}e_{k_n}])$$


	p Because this in linear in scalars:
	p $$f(M)=\sum_{k_1=1}^m...\sum_{k_n=1}\prod_{i=1}^ma_{ik_i}f([e_{k_1},...,e_{k_n}])$$
