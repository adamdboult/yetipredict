		b Norms
	p We can use norms to denote the "length" of a single vector.
	p \(||v||=\sqrt {v^TMv}\)
	h3
		b Euclidian norm
	p If \(M=I\) we have the Euclidian norm.
	p \(||v||=\sqrt{v^Tv}\)
	p \(||v||=\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}v^2_i}\)
	h3
		b Pythagoras' theorem
	p If \(n=2\) we have:
	p \(||v||=\sqrt{v_1^2+v_2^2}\)
	p We call the two inputs \(x\) and \(y\), and the length \(z\).
	p \(z=\sqrt {x^2+y^2}\)
	p \(z^2=x^2+y^2\)
	h3
		b Normed vector space
	p A normed vector space is a metric space where the distance between two vectors is the norm of the the difference between the two vectors.
