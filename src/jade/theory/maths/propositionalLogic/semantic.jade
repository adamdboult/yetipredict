	h3
		b Interpretations
	p An interpretation assigns meaning to propositional variables in a formula.
	p For example the interpretations of the formula \(\theta \lor \gamma \) assign values to each of \(\theta \) and \(\gamma \).
	h3
		b Satifisable
	p A formula is satisfisable if there is some interpretation where it is true.
	p For example \(\theta \) is satisfisable but \(\theta \land ¬\theta \) is not.
	h3
		b Tautology
	p A formula is a tautology if it is true in all interpretations.
	p Examples of tautologies include:
	ul
		li $$\theta \lor ¬\theta $$
	h3
		b Semantic consequence
	p A formula, \(A\), semantically implies another, \(B\), if for every interpretation of \(A\), \(B\) is true.
	p We show this with:
	p $$A\vDash B$$
	p Formula \(B\) is satisfisable if there is some \(A\) where this is true.
	p Formula \(B\) is a tautology if this is true for any \(A\). We can also write this as \(\vDash B\).
	h3
		b Logical equivalence
	p If \(A\vDash B\) and \(B\vDash A\) we say that \(A\) and \(B\) are logically equivalent.
	p This is shown as \(A \Leftrightarrow B\).
