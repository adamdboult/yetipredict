		b Substitution

	p If we have a tautology, then we can substitute the formula of any propositional variable with any formula to arrive at any other tautology.
	p
		b Example
	p Take the tautology:
	p $$\theta \rightarrow (\gamma \rightarrow \theta )$$
	p We can substitute any formulae into one of thes values to reach another tautology. For example we can set \(\theta \) to \(F\).
	p $$F \rightarrow (\gamma \rightarrow F)$$
	p This is also a tautology.

	p
		b Modus Ponens
	p If \(A\) implies \(B\), and \(A\) is true, then \(B\) is also true.
	p $$((\theta \rightarrow \gamma )\land (\theta ))\rightarrow \gamma $$
	p That is, if we can show that the following are true:
	p
	p $$\theta \rightarrow \gamma $$
	p $$\theta $$
	p We can infer that the following is also true:
	p $$\gamma $$
	h3
		b Induction
	p Using substitution we could take a tautology and generate additional tautologies. Induction allows us to generate new tautologies from \(2\) other tautologies.
	p Crucially, it also allows us to create tautologies without ever expanding the size of tautologies  in question, as substitution does.
	p
		b Example of inference
	p Let use these to derive a theorem:
	p $$\alpha \rightarrow \alpha $$
	p Start with axiom 2:
	p $$(\alpha \rightarrow (\beta \rightarrow \gamma ))\rightarrow ((\alpha \rightarrow \beta )\rightarrow(\alpha \rightarrow \gamma ))$$
	p Replace \(\gamma \) with \(\alpha \).
	p $$(\alpha \rightarrow (\beta \rightarrow \alpha ))\rightarrow ((\alpha \rightarrow \beta )\rightarrow(\alpha \rightarrow \alpha ))$$
	p Replace \(\beta \) with \((\alpha \rightarrow \alpha )\).
	p $$(\alpha \rightarrow ((\alpha \rightarrow \alpha ) \rightarrow \alpha ))\rightarrow ((\alpha \rightarrow (\alpha \rightarrow \alpha ))\rightarrow(\alpha \rightarrow \alpha ))$$
	p Separately, take axiom 1:
	p $$\alpha \rightarrow (\beta \rightarrow \alpha)$$
	p And replace \(\beta \) with \((\alpha \rightarrow \alpha )\)
	p $$\alpha \rightarrow ((\alpha \rightarrow \alpha )\rightarrow \alpha)$$
	p This is the left side of the above equation. Through modus ponens, we then know:
	p $$(\alpha \rightarrow (\alpha \rightarrow \alpha)) \rightarrow (\alpha \rightarrow \alpha)$$
	p We know the left is true through modus ponens, and so
	p $$\alpha \rightarrow \alpha $$

	h3
		b Consequences


	p Implies. Sytactic consequence
	p This means there exists a proof of \(\theta \) from theory \(T\), under a deduction rule. 
	p |-
	p \(T\vdash \theta \) shows that \(\theta \) is a theorem of the theory.

	p Semantic consequence
	p |=
	p For all interpreations of \(T\), if T is true, so is theta
	p \(T\vDash \theta \)

	p Modus ponens shows that:
	p We can get A|- B from |-A\rightarrow B

	h3
		b Theory
	p Results derived from substitution or induction are called theorems. Theorems often divided into:
	ul
		li Theorems - important results
		li Lemmas - results used for later theorems
		li Corollaries - readily deduced from a theorem


	p We take a set of axioms, as true, and a deduction rule which enables us to derive additional formulae, or theorems. The collection of axioms and theorems is known as the theory.
