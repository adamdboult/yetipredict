		b Normal form
	p This is where a formula is shown using only:	
	ul
		li And - \(\land \)
		li Or - \(\lor \)
		li Negation - \(Â¬\)
	h3
		b Conjunective normal form
	p The conjunctive normal form (CNF) is where a formula is converted to a normal form with the following layout:
	p $$a \land b \land c \land d$$
	p These letters can represent complex sub-formulae, in normal form.
	p Statements in this form are easier to evaluate, as each subformula can be evaluated separately. The statement is true only if all formulaes within are also true.
	h3
		b Disjunctive normal form
	p The disjunctive normal form (DNF) is similar for \(\lor \).
	p $$a \lor b \lor c \lor d$$
