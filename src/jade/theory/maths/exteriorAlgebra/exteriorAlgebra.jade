		b Introduction
	p The exterior algebra is the algebra generated by the wedge product.
	p The term \(u\land v\) can be interpreted as the area covered by the parallelogram generated by \(u\) and \(v\).
	p As \(a\mathbf u\land b\mathbf v=ab \mathbf u\land \mathbf v\), we can see that scaling the length of one of the vectors by a scalar, we also increase the exterior product by the same scalar.
	h3
		b Orientation
	p We can describe the exterior product of two vectors as \(\mathbf u\land \mathbf v\) or \(\mathbf v \land \mathbf u\).
