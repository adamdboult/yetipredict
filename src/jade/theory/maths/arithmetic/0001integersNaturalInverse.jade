		b Subtraction and division
	p We have inverse functions for addition and multiplication. These are subtraction and division respectively.
	p For function \(\oplus\), its inverse is \(\oplus' \), as defined below:
	p $$a\oplus b=c$$
	p $$b=c\oplus 'a$$
	p $$f(a,b)=c\rightarrow f^{-1}(c,b)=a$$

	p These will not necessarily have solutions for some sets of numbers. 
	h3
		b Subtraction
	p $$a+b=c\rightarrow b=c-a$$
	p There is no natural number \(b\) that satisfies:
	p $$3+b=2$$
	p While addition and multiplication are defined across all natural numbers, subtraction is not.

		b Division
	p $$a.b=c\rightarrow b=\frac{c}{a}$$
