		b Statement
	p If a prime number \(p\) divides product \(a.b\) then \(p\) must divide at least of one of \(a\) or \(b\).
	p
		b Proof
	p From Bezout's identity we know that:
	p $$d=px+by$$
	p Where \(p\) and \(b\) are natural numbers and \(d\) is their greatest common denominator.
	p Let's choose a prime number for \(p\). There are no common divisors, other than one. As a result there are exist values for \(x\) and \(y\) such that:
	p $$1=px+by$$
	p Now, we are trying to prove that if \(p\) divides \(a.b\) then \(p\) must divide at least one of \(a\) and \(b\), so let's multiply this by \(a\).
	p $$a=pax+aby$$
	p We know that \(p\) divides \(pax\), and \(p\) divides \(ab\) by definition. As a result \(p\) can divide \(a\).
	h3
		b Fundamental theorem of arithmetic
	p Each natural number is a prime or unique product of primes.
	p
		b Proof: existance of each number as a product of primes
	p If \(n\) is prime, no more is needed.
	p If \(n\) is not prime, then \(n=ab\), \(a,b\in \mathbb{N} \).
	p If \(a\) and \(b\) are prime, this is complete. Otherwise we can iterate to find:
	p $$n=\prod_{i=1} p_i$$
	
	p
		b Proof: this product of primes is unique
	p Consider two different series of primes for the same number:
	p $$s=\prod_{i=1}^n p_i = \prod_{i=1}^m q_i$$
	p We need to show that \(n=m\) and \({p}={q}\).
	p We know that \(p_i\) divides \(s\). We also know that through Euclid's lemma that if a prime number divides a non-prime number, then it must also divide one of its components. As a result \(p_i\) must divide one of \({q}\).
	p But as all of \({q}\) are prime then \(p_i\)=\(q_j\).
	p We can repeat this process to to show that \({p}={q}\) and therefore \(n=m\).


	p Alternative Euclidian Algorithm

	p $$lcm(a,b)$$
	p Then take 1, and then go through each prime number and multiply by the maximum number of those. For this this is
	p 2: 2
	p 3:1
	p So LCM=2^2.3^1=12

	p Or
	p LCM(a,b)=\frac{|a.b|}{GCD(a,b)}
	h3
		b Existence of an infinite number of prime numbers
	p If there are a finite number of primes, we can call the set of primes \(P\).
	p We identify a new natural number \(a\) by taking the product of existing primes and adding \(1\).
	p $$a=1+\prod_{p\in P} p$$
	p From the fundamental theorem of arithmetic we know all numbers are primes or the products of primes.
	p If \(a\) is not a prime then it can be divided by one of the existing primes to form number \(n\):
	p $$\frac{\prod^n p_i +1}{p_j}=n$$
	p $$\frac{p_j \prod^n_{i\ne j} p_i +1}{p_j}=n$$
	p $$\prod^n_{i\ne j} p_i +\frac{1}{p_j}=n$$
	p As this is not a whole number, \(n\) must prime.
	p We can do this process for any finite number of primes, so there are an infinite number.
