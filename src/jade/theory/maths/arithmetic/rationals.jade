	h3
		b Defining rational numbers
	p We previously defined integers in terms of natural numbers. Similarly we can define rational numbers in terms of integers.
	p $$\forall ab \in \mathbb{I} (¬(b=0)\rightarrow \exists c (b.c=a))$$
	p A rational is an ordered pair of integers.
	p $$\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}$$
	p So that:
	p $$\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}=\frac{a}{b}$$
	h3
		b Converting integers to rational numbers
	p Integers can be shown as rational numbers using:
	p $$(i,1)$$
	p Integers can then be turned into rational numbers:
	p $$\mathbb{Q}=\frac{a}{1}$$
	p $$a=\frac{a_1}{a_2}$$
	p $$b=\frac{b_1}{b_2}$$
	p $$c=\frac{c_1}{c_2}$$

	h3
		b Equivalence classes of rationals
	p There are an infinite number of ways to write any rational number, as with integers. \(\frac{1}{2}\) can be written as \(\frac{1}{2}\), \(\frac{-2}{-4}\) etc.
	p The class of these terms form an equivalence class.
	p We can show these are equal:
	p $$\frac{a}{b}=\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}$$
	p $$\frac{ca}{cb}=\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}$$
	p $$\frac{ca}{cb}=\{\{ca\},\{ca,cb\}\}$$
	p $$\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}=\{\{ca\},\{ca,cb\}\}$$
	h3
		b Cardinality of rational numbers
	p We can see rational numbers as cartesian products of integers. That is:
	p $$\mathbb{Q}=Z.Z$$
	p We can order the rational numbers like so:
	p $$\{\frac{1}{1},\frac{2}{1},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{3},\frac{2}{2}\frac{3}{1}…\}$$
	p These can be mapped from natural numbers, so there is a bijunctive function.
	p So:
	p \(|\mathbb{Q} |=|\mathbb{Z}.\mathbb{Z} |=|\mathbb{N} |=\aleph_0\)
	p As: \(|\mathbb{Z}.\mathbb{Z} |=|\mathbb{Z}|^2\)
	p $$|\mathbb{N}|^n=\mathbb{N}$$

	h3
		b Rational addition
	p Then we can define addition as:
	p $$(a,b)+(c,d)=(a.d+b.c,b.d)$$
	p $$a+b=c$$
	p $$c_1=a_1b_2+a_2b_1$$
	p $$c_1=a_2b_2$$
	h3
		b Rational subtraction
	p $$a-b=c$$
	p $$c_1=a_1b_2-a_2b_1$$
	p $$c_1=a_2b_2$$
	h3
		b Rational multiplication
	p Similarly, multiplication can be defined as:
	p $$(a,b).(c,d)=(a.c, b.d)$$
	p $$ab=c$$
	p $$c_1=a_1b_1$$
	p $$c_1=a_2b_2$$
	h3
		b Rational division
	p $$\frac{a}{b}=c$$
	p $$c_1=a_1b_2$$
	p $$c_1=a_2b_1$$


	h3
		b Rationals are dense in rationals
	p For any pair of rationals, there is another rational between them:
	p $$a=\frac{p}{q}$$
	p $$b=\frac{m}{n}$$
	p Where \(b>a\).
	p We define a new rational:
	p $$c=\frac{a+b}{2}$$
	p $$c=\frac{pn+qm}{2qn}$$
	p This is a rational number.
	p We can write:
	p $$a=\frac{2pn}{2qn}$$
	p $$b=\frac{2qm}{2qn}$$
	p As \(b>a\) we know \(2qm>2pn\)
	p So: \(a < c < b\)
