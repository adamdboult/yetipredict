		b Charts
	p A chart is a mapping from each point in a subset of the manifold (in this case the circle) to a point in a vector space.
	p These charts are invertible. If we are given coordinates, we can identify the point in the manifold it comes from.
	h3
		b Universal charts
	p If the vector space is flat and non-repeating, then a single chart can be used to map the whole manifold.
	h3
		b Choice of basis for charts
	p Orthogonal; orthonormal; rotations
	h3
		b Overlapping charts
	p If two charts cover some of the same points on a manifold then we can define a function for those points where we move from one vector to another.
	p For example, if the first chart maps a point to \(\{1\}\) in a \(1\)-dimensional vector space, and the second chart maps it to \(\{2\}\), then we have a function between the charts which maps \(\{1\}\) to \(\{2\}\).
	p We can move between maps. use of chart and use inverse of another chart. it is this that needs to be differentiated.
	p We can represent moving between charts as:
	p \(ab^{-1}\)

		b Atlases
	p If we have a collection of charts which covers each point needs to be covered at least once, we have an atlas. Each chart needs to be to the same dimensional vector space.
