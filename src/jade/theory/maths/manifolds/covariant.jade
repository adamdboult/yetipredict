	p essentially as we move across path, we are changing the basis.

	p we can look at how basis vector change as we translate

	p we can define as basis as:

	p \(e_i=\frac{\delta x}{\delta x_i}\)

	p how to measure transport

	p if we take a vector and move it around a curved surface and return it to the same point, it may not face the same way

	p eg if you're on equator, move east, north, south to equator, you'll face diffrent direction

	p this is true on smaller movements of a curved surface

	p we can use this to measure curvature of a manifold without coordinates
