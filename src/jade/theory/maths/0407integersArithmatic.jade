	p For any two non-zero natural numbers (or integers) \(a\) we can select natural numbers (or integers) \(x\) and \(y\) such that
	$$ax+by=c$$
	p The value of \(c\) is always a multiple of the greatest common denominator of \(a\) and \(b\).
	p In addition, there exist \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(c\) is the greatest common denominator itself. This is the smallest positve value of c..
	p
		b Proof
	p Let's take two numbers of the form \(ax+by\):
	$$d=as+bt$$
	$$n=ax+by$$
	p Where \(n>d\). And \(d\) is the smallest non-zero natural number form.
	p We know from Euclidian division above that for any numbers \(i\) and \(j\) there is the form \(i=jq+r\).
	p So there are values for \(q\) and \(r\) for \(n=dq+r\).
	p If \(r\) is always zero that means that all values of \(ax+by\) are multiples of the smallest value.
	p \(n=dq+r\) so \(r=n-dq\).
	p $$r=ax+by-(as+bt)q$$
	p $$r=a(x-sq)+b(y-tq)$$
	p This is also of the form \(ax+by\). Recall that \(r\) is the remainder for the division of \(d\) and \(n\), and that \(d=ax+by\) is the smallest positive value.
	p \(r\) cannot be above or equal to \(d\) due to the rules of euclidian division and so it must be \(0\).
	p As a result we know that all solutions to \(ax+by\) are multiples of the smallest value.
	p As every possible \(ax+by\) is a multiple of \(d\), \(d\) must be a common divisor to both numbers. This is because \(a.0+b.1\) and \(a.1+b.0\) are also solutions, and \(d\) is their divisor.
	p So we know that the smallest positive solution is a common mutliple of both numbers.
	p We now need to show that that \(d\) is the largest common denominator. Consider a common denominator \(c\).
	p $$a=pc$$
	p $$b=qc$$
	p And as before:
	p $$d=ax+by$$
	p So:
	p $$d=pcx+qcy$$
	p $$d=c(px+qy)$$
	p So \(d\ge c\)
	h3
		b Euclid's lemma
	p If a prime number \(p\) divides product \(a.b\) then \(p\) must divide at least of one of \(a\) or \(b\).
	p
		b Proof
	p From Bezout's identity we know that:
	p $$d=px+by$$
	p Where \(p\) and \(b\) are natural numbers and \(d\) is their greatest common denominator.
	p Let's choose a prime number for \(p\). There are no common divisors, other than one. As a result there are exist values for \(x\) and \(y\) such that:
	p $$1=px+by$$
	p Now, we are trying to prove that if \(p\) divides \(a.b\) then \(p\) must divide at least one of \(a\) and \(b\), so let's multiply this by \(a\).
	p $$a=pax+aby$$
	p We know that \(p\) divides \(pax\), and \(p\) divides \(ab\) by definition. As a result \(p\) can divide \(a\).
	h3
		b Fundamental theorem of arithmetic
	p Each natural number is a prime or unique product of primes.
	p
		b Proof: existance of each number as a product of primes
	p If \(n\) is prime, no more is needed.
	p If \(n\) is not prime, then \(n=ab\), \(a,b\in \mathbb{N} \).
	p If \(a\) and \(b\) are prime, this is complete. Otherwise we can iterate to find:
	p $$n=\prod_{i=1} p_i$$
	
	p
		b Proof: this product of primes is unique
	p Consider two different series of primes for the same number:
	p $$s=\prod_{i=1}^n p_i = \prod_{i=1}^m q_i$$
	p We need to show that \(n=m\) and \({p}={q}\).
	p We know that \(p_i\) divides \(s\). We also know that through Euclid's lemma that if a prime number divides a non-prime number, then it must also divide one of its components. As a result \(p_i\) must divide one of \({q}\).
	p But as all of \({q}\) are prime then \(p_i\)=\(q_j\).
	p We can repeat this process to to show that \({p}={q}\) and therefore \(n=m\).


	p Alternative Euclidian Algorithm

	p $$lcm(a,b)$$
	p Then take 1, and then go through each prime number and multiply by the maximum number of those. For this this is
	p 2: 2
	p 3:1
	p So LCM=2^2.3^1=12

	p Or
	p LCM(a,b)=\frac{|a.b|}{GCD(a,b)}
