		b Predicates, constants , functions and terms

	p We expand propositional variables to refer to terms. For example in with propositional variables we could represent the statement “You are \(25\) years old” with:
	p $$\theta $$
	p With predicate calculus we could introduce a predicate meaning “term \(t\) is \(25\) years old”. 
	p $$P(t)$$
	p And in the original example:
	p $$P(you)$$
	p We could also expand the predicate to include additional terms, such as:
	p $$R(you,25)$$
	p A propositional variable can be considered a special case of a predicate variable, where the number of inputs is \(0\).
	p We may also be interested in adding functions. Functions take other terms, and are themselves terms. For example if we wanted to know the age because of a law in a country, we could use:
	p $$R(you,age(britain))$$
	p A function may not be able to produce an output for all inputs. For examples what is "chair" \(+1\)? Or \(\frac{1}{0}\)?
	p The functions are not defined in these domains.
	p Like predicates, functions can also take different numbers of inputs. Constants, such as “you” and “britain” could be considered functions with \(0\) inputs. As a result we could instead use:
	p $$R(you(),age(britain()))$$
	p We generally denote functions with a lower case letter, so would instead write:
	p $$R(y(),a(b()))$$
