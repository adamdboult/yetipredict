		b Introduction
	p For fixed effects, we had the requirement that group membership be uncorrelated with the error term, but that it could be correlated with other independent variables.
	p For random effects models, group membership cannot be correlated with other variables.
	p We have:
	p \(y_{ij}=\alpha + X_{ij}\theta +\epsilon_{ij}+U_{ij}\)
	p We now model \(U_{ij}=\bar U_{j}+\rho_j\).
	p \(y_{ij}=\alpha + X_{ij}\theta +\epsilon_{ij}+\bar U_{j}+\rho_j\)
	p This randomness of the effect implies, for example, that if we ran the survey again we would expect a different effect.
