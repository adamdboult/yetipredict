		b Introduction
	p We can use a version of Metropolis-Hastings to find the global maximum of a function \(f(x)\).
	p We start with an arbitrary point \(x_0\).
	p We move randomly from this to identiy a candidate point \(x_c\).
	p We accept this with probability depending on the the relationship between \(x_0\) and \(x_c\).
	p This process will converge on the global maximum.

		b Hyperparameter
	p There is a hyperparameter for selection. At the extreme this becomes a greedy function.
