		b Introduction
	p As with Metropolis-Hastings, we want to generate samples for \(P(X)\) and use this to approximate its form.
	p We do this by using the conditional distribution. If \(X\) is a vector then we also have:
	p \(P(x_j|x_0,...,x_{j-1},x_{j+1},...,x_n)\)
	p We use our knowledge of this distribution.
