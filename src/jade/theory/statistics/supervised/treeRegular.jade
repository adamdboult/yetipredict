		b Introduction
	p Generally we would split the data up. Grow the tree with one set and then prune with the other.
	p When pruning, for each pair of leaves we test to see if they should be merged.

		b Growing and pruning
	p We can split our data up and iterate between growing and pruning.
	p If our two sets are \(A\) and \(B\) we can do:
	ul
		li \(A\): Grow
		li \(B\): Prune
		li \(B\): Grow
		li \(A\): Prune
	p And repeat this process.
