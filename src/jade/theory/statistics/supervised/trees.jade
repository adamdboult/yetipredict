	p start with all outcomes in same node. then do greedy search: which feature best splits
	p then iterate this
	p for each have node purity, all examples go to a sub branch
	p how to do split? ne which maximises entropy
	p entropy = -\sum_i^n p_i\log_2 p_i
	p gain in entropy = original entropy - weighted by size entropy of each branch

	p can prune trees by cutting off at some point, or pruning after completing full tree
	p can remove subtee if performance isn't affected on validation set for example


	p unbalanced dataset: more of one class than others
	p can reduce sample of majorit, or synthetically generate minority

	p Information gain ratio
