		b Defining
	p One option for \(f(X)\) is a linear model.
	p $$f(X_i)=\hat{Y_i}= \beta_0+\sum_{j=1}^p\beta_iX_{ij}$$
	p The values for \(\beta \) are the regression coefficients.
	p So we have:
	p $$Y_i=\beta_0+\sum_{j=1}^p\beta_iX_{ij}+e(X_i)+e_i$$
	p We define the error of the estimate as:
	p $$\epsilon_i=Y_i-\hat{Y_i}$$
	p $$\epsilon_i=e(X_i)+e_i $$
	p So:
	p $$Y_i=\beta_0+\sum_{j=1}^p\beta_iX_{ij}+\epsilon_i$$
	p The linear model could be wrong for two reasons. No linear model could be appropriate, or the wrong coefficients could be provided for a linear model.

		b Creating linear models
	p Adding squared, logs, exponents etc


	p taylor series
	p logs, exponents can be used
	p can have interactiosn between variables
	p Linear models can represent complex non-linear relationships.
	p If the underlying relationship is non-linear, for example \(E(Y|X)=5+3x^2\), we can still represent this as a linear model.
	p We can create a new variable \(z=x^2\) and then use the model:
	p \(y=\theta_+\theta_1z\)
