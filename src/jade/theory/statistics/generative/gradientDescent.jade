		b Introduction
	p There are \(3\) main algorithms for gradient descent:
	ul
		li Batch gradient descent
		li Stochastic gradient descent
		li Mini-batch gradient descent
	h3
		b Batch gradient descent
	p Do gradient descent on all samples
	p The standard gradient descent algorithm above is also known as batch gradient descent. There are other implementations.

	h3
		b Stochastic gradient descent
	p Do gradient descent on one (?!) sample only

	p not guaranteed for each step to go towards minimum, but each step much faster
	h3
		b Mini batch gradient descent
	p use b samples on each iteration, b is parameter, between stochastic and batch
	p b=2-100 for example
