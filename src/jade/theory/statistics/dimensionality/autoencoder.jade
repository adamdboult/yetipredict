		b Introduction
	p Autoencoders are a type of neural network.

	p For autoencoders the goal for the output layer is the reconstructed input layer, rather than a classification.

	p By including sparsity in the neural network we can reduce the dimensions. This splits the network into an encoder and a decoder.
