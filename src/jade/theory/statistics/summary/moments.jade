		b Sample mean
	p We previously defined the population mean is defined as \(\mu=E[X]\).
	p The sample mean is defined as \(\bar x = \frac{1}{n}\sum_i x_i\).
	h3
		b Sample variance
	p We previously defined the population variance as \(\sigma^2=E[(X-\mu)^2]\).
	p We define the sample variance as \(\sigma^2=\frac{1}{n}\sum_i(x_i-\bar x)^2\).
	p We can calculate this using matrices:
	p \(M=X-\bar x\)
	p \(\sigma^2=\frac{1}{n}M^TM\).
