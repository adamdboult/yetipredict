	p How does back propagation work through the conv layer?
	p Domain specific nn
	p Can connect each  node in first hidden layer to a subset of the input layer, eg one node for each 5x5 pixels
	p We also share weights for each of the first layer. Much fewer parameters, and can learn all good stuff
	p First layer is called the feature map
	p Can have multiple conv layers running in parallel, 
	p Pooling layers
	p Pooling layer compresses, takes 2x2. Max pooling returns highest activiation
	p each conv layer feeds into pooling layer
	p Pooling layers (L2 pooling, other types)
	p How does back prob work?
