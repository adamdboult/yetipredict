	p When we take statistics we are often concerned with inferring properties of the underlying probability function.
	p As the properties of the probability distribution function affect the chance of observing the sample, we can analyse samples to infer properties of the underlying distribution.
	p There are many properties would could be interested in. This includes moments and parameters of a specific probability distribution function.
	p An estimator is a statistic which is our estimate of one of these values.

	p Emphasise that statistics and estimators are different things. A statistic may be terrible estimator, but be useful for other purposes. 


	h3
		b Bias of an estimator
	p An estimator is a function of sample. The bias of an estimator is defined as:
	p $$Bias_\theta [\hat \theta ]:=E_\theta [\hat \theta -\theta ]$$

	p We have the actual outcome, \(y_i\), and the predicted outcome \(\hat{y_i}\).
	p The predicted outcome is a function of \(x_i\) and \(\theta \).
	p \(\hat{y_i} = f(x_i, \hat{\theta })\)
	p We want to choose parameters \(\hat{\theta }\).
