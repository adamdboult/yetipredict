		b Introduction
	p Classification models are a type of regression model, where \(y\) is discrete rather than continuous.
	p So we want to find a mapping from a vector \(X\) to probabilities across discrete \(y\) values.
	p A classifier takes \(X\) and returns a vector.
	p For a classifier we have \(K\) classes.

		b Hard and soft classifiers
	p A hard classifier can return a sparce vector with \(1\) in the relevant classification.
	p A soft classifier returns probabilities for each entry in the vector.

	p The vector represents  \(P(Y=k|X=x)\)
