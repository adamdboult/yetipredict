		b Offline learning
	p In offline learning, the model is trained where all data is available, and is not designed to incorporate additional incoming data.
	p Here time is more readily available.

		b Online learning
	p In offline learning, the the model is updated as more data comes in.
	p Here, we may wish to update the model more quickly.
	p We also have access to the original model.


	p Continuous steam of info, eg users coming to site

	p no training algorithm, just learn then discard
	p makes more sense when data v large, can afford to discard if data unlimited

	p can adapt to changing underlying data generation process

	p Product search example:
	p user searches "android phone 1080p camera"
	p have 100, which to show?
	p features: features of phone, how many words in user query match name, how many words in query match description etc

	p make prediction of chance to click, learn if they do. trade off between learn, show best

	p other examples: special offers, news articles, product recommendations
