		b Money


	p Liquidity (don’t always want a goat)
	p Alice fishes and Bob hunts, and they trade meat and fish with each other. This much fish for that much meat. This all works perfectly well until Carol, Dan and Eve come along, who wants to trade berries, wood and furs. Now agreeing how much of this for that becomes more complicated, for every good there’s a ratio relative to every other good.
	p So they agree a new system, they collect all of the shells on the island and use these to trade with each other. Now they only have to remember a price for each good.
	p Information requirements \((n-1)+(n-2)\) etc v \((n-1)\)
	p $$\sum_{i=1}^n n-i$$
	p $$n^2-\sum_{i=1}^n i$$
	p $$n^2-\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$
	p $$\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$$
	p Compared to \(n-1\) when money is used.
