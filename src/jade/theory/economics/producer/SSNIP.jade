	p Small but significant and non-transitory increase in price
	p Would this cause customers to move elsewhere?
	p If we have demand at different prices we can estimate whether it is worth monopolising the market.
	p Because this lack of motivation may be because of competitor goods, we can include these to see if that market is worth monopolising.
	p For example: hiking up the price of one good may not be profitable. Therefore that is not a relevant market (though it could be!). Then we can see if hiking up the price of that good, and others, is profitable. If so, then it is a relevant market.

	p Note:
	p High elasticity may be because monopoly power is already being exerted
