		b Measuring demand elasticity
	p Demand elasticity
	p we measure elsaticities as they are. there may be existing cmpetition barriers which cause current substitution. without current monopolies, there may be more unique markets.

	p eg monopolist has product with sbustitutve, but it is only substitute because the monopolist has kept the price so high.

	p hard to measure elasticity due to endogeneity. better approach would be look for external shocks or surveys for demand elasticity
