		b Introduction

	p With non-discrete choice a consumer chooses how much of product \(x\) to consume.

	p The utility function is of the form:

	p \(U(x_1,...,x_m;d)\)

	p And the consumer chooses how much of \(x_i\) to consume to maximise this, subject to the budget constraint.

	p We include features relating to the individual, \(d\)

		b The outside option
	p We need to know the market share of the outside option. Do thsi theoretically. Eg number of customers in area, and 1 per day.

		b Overview of multinomial classification

	p With discrete choice the utility function is of the form:

	p \(U_j=f_j(p,d)+\epsilon_j \)

	p The individual chooses the product \(j\) with the highest utility.

	p Linear utility allows us to use linear classification. For example we can write:

	p \(U_j=\alpha x_j -\beta p_j +\epsilon_{j}\)

	p Herre utility depends on characteristics of the product \(x_j\) and the price \(p_j\).

	p We can also add observables of the individual.

	p \(U_j=\alpha x_j -\beta p_j +\theta_j d_i  + \epsilon_{j}\)

	p We can convert this to the form:

	p \(U_j=\Theta z_j + \epsilon_{j}\)
