		b Introduction

	p With non-discrete choice a consumer chooses how much of product \(x\) to consume.

	p The utility function is of the form:

	p \U(x_1,...,x_m;d)\)

	p And the consumer chooses how much of \(x_i\) to consume to maximise this, subject to the budget constraint.

	p We include features relating to the individual, \(d\)

		b Overview of multinomial classificationt

	p With discrete choice the utility function is of the form:

	p \(U_j=f_j(p,d)+\epsilon_j \)

	p The individual chooses the product \(j\) with the highest utility.

	p Linear utility allows us to use linear classification. For example we can write:

	p \(U_j=\alpha x_j -\beta p_j +\epsilon_{j}\)

	p Herre utility depends on characteristics of the product \(x_j\) and the price \(p_j\).

	p We can also add observables of the individual.

	p \(U_j=\alpha x_j -\beta p_j +\theta_j d_i  + \epsilon_{j}\)

	p We can convert this to the form:

	p \(U_j=\Theta z_j + \epsilon_{j}\)

	h3
		b Extreme IID classification

	p If errors are IID and extreme we get:

	p \(s_j=\dfrac{e^{\Theta z_j}{\sum_k e^{\Theta z_k }\)

	h3
		b Outside option

	p A user has the option of not buying anything.

	p \(U_0=0\)

	p This gives us the following shares:

	p \(s_j=\dfrac{e^{\Theta z_j}{e^0+\sum_{k=1} e^{\Theta z_k }\)

	p \(s_j=\dfrac{e^{\Theta z_j}{1+\sum_{k=1} e^{\Theta z_k }\)

	h3
		b Assumptions

	p All consumers face the same prices and products

	p the may be discounts,

	h3
		b Price elasticity of demand

	p \(s_j=\dfrac{e^{\Theta z_j}{1+\sum_{k=1} e^{\Theta z_k }\)

	p \(s_j=\dfrac{e^{\alpha x_j -\beta p_j + \theta_j d_i}{1+\sum_{k=1} e^{ \alpha x_k -\beta p_k +\theta_k d_i}\)

	p \(\dfrac{\delta s_j }{\delta p_j}\dfrac{p_j}{s_j}=-\beta p_j(1-s_j)\)

	p \(\dfrac{\delta s_j }{\delta p_k}\dfrac{p_j}{s_j}=\beta p_ks_j\)

	p This means that the lower the price, the lower the own price elasticity of demand.

	p This means that mark ups are higher for cheaper goods, which doesn't always match reality.

	p This can be adjusted by changing the form. For example we could use ln p or p^2

	p However, we are still getting the shape by assumption.

	h3
		b Using nested logit

	p With IID all goods are equal substitutes. If prices rise customers will switch to others in proportion to market size.

	p In practice if the price of a cheap car rises, there will be more substitution to other cheap cars than expensive cars.

	p Nested logit can address this.
	h3
		b Discrete choice and dimensionality

	p Discrete choice models allows for demand curves to be derived with far fewer parameters.

	p Previously if there were 100 goods with 100 prices, the demand curve for each price would have to include parameters for each of the 100 prices.

	p The discrete choice formulation has few fewer parameters.
